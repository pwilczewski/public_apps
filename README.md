# Links to apps
Welcome to my repo! It contains a selection of projects that I've worked on over the past year. These projects inclue both apps and research, mostly in AI and finance. The research is entirely open, but several of the apps use private code due to concerns about API access. However they are deployed on the streamlit cloud and available at the links below:

1. [gutentalk](https://gutentalk-hxzexcfa5ypafpptgxfds2.streamlit.app/): uses retrieval augmented generation to chat with open source books
2. [askfred](https://askfred-ga5fmbfr8l8pbmhnsfpa4w.streamlit.app/): uses a langchain agent to chat with the Federal Reserve Economic Database
3. [botjanov](https://botjanov-e7mbnckud9geebw6rf9vom.streamlit.app/): an LLM that responds only in memes

Also one gradio app is available on huggingface:

4. [banking crisis dashboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/pwilczewski/banking_crisis_dashboard): tracking banking data since the collapse of SVB
